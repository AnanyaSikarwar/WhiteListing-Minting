# WhiteListing-Minting
A smart contract system for managing whitelist-based NFT minting. This repository includes Solidity contracts and supporting scripts that allow only pre-approved (whitelisted) addresses to mint tokens during an exclusive minting phase. Ideal for NFT projects with private sale rounds or early access drops.

Features:

Whitelist-based access control using Merkle Trees

Gas-optimized smart contract for efficient minting

Secure verification of addresses before minting

Configurable minting limits and start times

Tech Stack:

Solidity

Hardhat / Foundry (depending on your setup)

Merkle Tree (OpenZeppelin or custom implementation)
